    """
    This function steps over each residue of a chain and  writes to a PDB file the atoms.
    No hydrogen atom is added. To add hydrogen atoms use PRAS.py instead

    Arguments (this function takes 6 compulsory arguments)
    ----------
    pdb_pras:    the syntactically correct PDB file to repair/analyze (.pdb or .cif format)

    rotamer:     by default, atoms with the highest occupancy are written to PDB file in
                 the case of rotamers. If you want low occupancy instead, supply "no" or
                 any string as the argument, otherwise supply "" as argument.

    mutation:    when there is point mutation, two residues with unequal
                 occupany (i.e. the residue atoms) are given same residue number.
                 By default the residue with the highest occupancy is
                 written to PDB file. If you want low occupancy instead supply "no"
                 or any string as the argument, otherwise supply "" as argument.

    pdb_faspr:   the PDB file obtained from FASPR (by running the same PDB supplied to PRAS).
                 FASPR is a free and open source side-chain packer, thanks to Huang et al.
                 You can obtain it at https://github.com/tommyhuangthu/FASPR

                 Note that if there are no missing atoms that require flexible chi to fix then
                 FASPR is not required. If there are such atoms and you do not supply FASPR PDB file,
                 PRAS will use the default or most probable chi from Dunbrack 2011 rotamer library
                 to fix the atoms. So in any case PRAS will run but will notify you if FASPR PDB is
                 not supplied.

                 Although FASPR is more accurate than most state-of-the-art side-chain packers,
                 it is not infinitely accurate and sometimes the default chi from PRAS is the
                 right conformation for the amino acid residue side-chain. It is advised that
                 you compare both methods when necessary.

                 Be mindful of the fact that FASPR may be less flexible with reading PDB files and
                 has no mechanism to process .cif files or use lower conformers in the case of
                 rotamers/mutation. To avoid manual editing, pass the PDB through PRAS first.
                 Also, for repairing .cif, you can use the equivalent of that in .pdb obtained from
                 FASPR since it cannot process a .cif file. The chain PRAS obtains from .pdb is the
                 same as .cif if both are the same structure, even though it reads .cif differently!

    keep_ligand: by default, ligands and entries with HETATM are ignored because in most
                 MD simulation and docking studies the ligand is specially treated. Moreover,
                 PRAS does not repair ligands (ligand structure is diverse compared with protein
                 with 20 repeating common amino acids!). However, user can supply any string as
                 the argument if user intends to keep ligands.

    chain_no   : by default, all the chains in the PDB will be processed. However, if user intends to
                 use a specific chain, user should provide an integer or a string number as the argument.
                 PRAS will map the integer to alphabets. Chain can start with any letter. Thus,
                 1 = the first chain, 2 = the second chain, etc. If user supplies a string number, PRAS
                 will convert it to integer but if alphabet error will be generated.

    Returns
    -------
    None:        repaired PDB structure without hydrogen atoms will be written.
                 Ensure you have write permission in the directory where you
                 run the program
